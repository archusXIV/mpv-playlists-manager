mpm version 1.4-3

   MPV-PLAYLISTS-MANAGER usage:

   !!! YOU CAN CHANGE MPM DIRECTORIES BY EDITING THE VARIABLES IN THE MPMRC FILE !!!
   By default "$HOME"/.local/share/
   Dependencies: ffmpeg, jq, mpv, vim, youtube-dl, yt-dlp (for better results).
   Optionals: parallel, ranger (can be any terminal file manager), ueberzug, wmctrl, w3m.
   We possibly use some options to directly edit, load a playlist:
      . mpm -c: opens ~/.config/mpm/mpmrc
      . mpm -e: opens the playlist edition function
      . mpm -h: launch less /usr/local/share/doc/mpm/help
      . mpm -l: opens the playlist load (online) function
      . mpm -p: opens local files or directory function
      . mpm -v: echoes mpm version and exit
   
   Changing the "theme" in ~/.config/mpm/themerc:
      Variables: nc=normal text, critical=warnings, info=normal prompt
      mtitle=menus title, task=infos like: direct download, audio conversion type etc...
      Colors of warnings, prompts etc... can be changed in you mpmrc file with
      shell colors syntax and RGB/HEX values. Two methods are provided.
      Documentation here: https://misc.flogisoft.com/bash/tip_colors_and_formatting
        
   a) Using console_colors (default) will always use your current ~/.Xresources colors
      if you have set them or if you use a modern terminal with colors settings available.
       
   b) Using custom rgb colors (206;34;30) and hex (#ff00ff) so you can set your own
      "theme" with existing ones as models.
    
   Usage:

   I) Main menu:

      └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                          Select an item


   1) Create/Add video playlist:
      Links saved here and in audio section too are not permanent, they will be erased
      when closing the program...unless you answer yes when prompted to save them.
      In this section we will be able to create a temporary video playlist by "copy/paste"
      urls from Youtube.com or any other supported web site by youtube-dl/yt-dlp packages.
      See https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/docs/supportedsites.md
      Once into the video options menu we can add tested links to a temporary list,
      youtube playlists are supported. Now we have six dedicated options.
      See II) audio/video files options:

   2) Create/Add audio playlist:
      Same as above but for audio only, for example after downloading, ffmpeg will
      convert all .webm files into mp3, flac, ogg or wav if you wish (settings in mpmrc).
      New since version 1.4-2, parallel package (if installed) will speed up audio conversion.
      Note that for youtube audio files the download is automatic (code 251 .webm).

   3) Save tmp/Del collection:
      Here we can save the default playlist as a new one wich contains all temporary links
      from video/audio sections and save video/audio separetly, all playlists are associated
      with a .titles file.
      Note that names with spaces will be renamed with underscores.
      We can also delete existing playlists (.m3u files) from our collection.

   4) Play/Download a playlist:
      If the default list is still filled with links we can stream audios or videos from it,
      if not the dedicated options will not appear.
      Now we still have the choice to play or download media links from the collection.
      Two downloading methods are offered here: one by choosing specidics format codes,
      and a direct download functionality which grabs the best format.
      In the download options there are two of them where we can choose individual or ranges
      of files to stream or download by entering their numbers as follow:
      for example:
                  1-4,6 8-11 # range,single range
                  1-4,6-8,10 # range,range,single
                  2,3,5,6,1  # random singles

   5) Load local dir/files: the following method uses ranger.
      The possibility of watching or listening media files from disk is done with ranger
      as a dependency. The default music and video directories are ~/Music & ~/Videos,
      Change the local variables in _LoadLocal function if needed.
      To use ranger in this function, just get mpvc script, and place it in your PATH.
      https://github.com/lwilletts/mpvc/blob/master/mpvc
      Than in "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME"/ranger/rifle.conf:
      change lines (124-125) 124) mpvc add -- "$@" 125) mpvc add --fs -- "$@"
      Make sure that you have enabled; set preview_images_method ueberzug (has to be installed)
      if you do not use URxvt for example (w3m works fine for URxvt/xterm).

   6) View default playlist:
      All links we enter are added in this file (default.m3u), at least we can save,
      download, play it and view titles in case we closed the program and forgot them.
      
   7) Clear all tmp lists:
      Sometimes it is preferable to clear everything and restart from the bottom ground.

   8) Edit a playlist:
      Here is the place where by editing our collection we can add or remove links
      directly or afterward. Vim is set as the MPMEDITOR (change it if you will).

   9) Edit mpm config (mpmrc):
      We may want to edit this file for default directories & tasks preferences,
      colors and better quality or results with mpv, ffmpeg and yt-dlp downloader options.
      After changing parameters and saving the file, they will be immediatly active.

   II) audio/video files options:

                                    ::audio options::
               ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
               │     1) Add audio links           4) Play current list      │
               │     2) Download current list     5) View current list      │
               │     3) Save playlist as          6) Back to main menu      │
               └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                       Select an item

   The same menu is also prensented in video section.
   Now in this menu it cannot be simpler as it is, all options are applied to the specific
   temporary file and we act directly on it, by entering '5' we will get more infos (titles)
   about the links and a prompt will present the same options as in the menu,
   but now [R]emoving the specific file is available...
