MPV-PLAYLISTS-MANAGER usage:

    !!! YOU CAN CHANGE MPM DIRECTORIES BY EDITING THE VARIABLES IN THE SCRIPT !!!
    By default "$HOME"/Documents/mpv-playlists-manager/
    Dependencies: ffmpeg, jq, mpv, vim, youtube-dl, yt-dlp (for better results).
    Optionals: ranger, wmctrl, w3m.
    We possibly use some options to directly edit, load a playlist:
        . mpm -e: opens the playlist edition function
        . mpm -l: opens the playlist load (online) function
        . mpm -p: opens the playlist load (local) function
    After we are done, we are dropped in the main menu.
    
    I) Main menu:

                ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
                │  1) Create/Add video playlist     6) View default playlist  │
                │  2) Create/Add audio playlist     7) Clear all tmp lists    │
                │  3) Save tmp/Del collection       8) Edit a playlist        │
                │  4) Play/Download a playlist      9) Edit mpv.conf          │
                │  5) Load local dir/files          X) Exit                   │
                └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘


    1) Create/Add video playlist:
       Links saved here and in audio section too are not permanent, they will be erased
       when closing the program... So be carefull and saved them before it is too late.
       In this section we will be able to create a temporary video playlist by "copy/paste"
       urls from Youtube.com or any other supported web site by youtube-dl/yt-dlp packages.
       See https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/docs/supportedsites.md
       After the first entry this will drop us into the video options menu where we test
       entries one by one before adding them in playlists.Now we have six dedicated options.
       See II) audio/video files options:

    2) Create/Add audio playlist:
       Same as above but for audio only, for example after downloading, ffmpeg will
       convert all .webm files into mp3, flac, ogg or wav if you wish.

    3) Save tmp/Del collection:
       Here we can save the default playlist as a new one wich contains all temporary links
       from video/audio sections and save video/audio separetly.
       They will be removed as we save them in the collection.
       We can also delete existing playlists (.m3u files) from our collection.

    4) Play/Download a playlist:
       If the default list is still filled with links we can stream audios or videos from it,
       if not the dedicated options will not appear.
       Now we still have the choice to play or download media links from the collection.
       Two downloading methods are offered here: one by choosing specidics format codes,
       and a direct download functionality which grabs the best format.

    5) Load local dir/files:
       The possibility of watching or listening media files from disk is done with ranger
       as a dependency. The default music and video directories are ~/Music & ~/Videos,
       Change the local variables in _LoadLocal function if needed.
       To use ranger in this function, just get mpvc script, and place it in your PATH.
       https://github.com/lwilletts/mpvc/blob/master/mpvc
       Than in "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME"/ranger/rifle.conf:
       change lines (124-125) 124) mpvc add -- "$@" 125) mpvc add --fs -- "$@"
       Make sure that you have enabled; set preview_images_method ueberzug (has to be installed)
       if you do not use URxvt for example (w3m works fine for URxvt/xterm).

    6) View default playlist:
       All links we enter are added in this file (default.m3u), at least we can save it,
       download, play it and view titles in case we closed the program and forgot them.

    7) Clear all tmp lists:
       Sometimes it is preferable to clear everything and restart from the bottom ground.

    8) Edit a playlist:
       Here is the place where by editing our collection we can add or remove links
       directly or afterward. Vim is set as the EDITOR (change it if you will).

    9) Edit mpv.conf:
       we may want to edit this file for better results, quality and learning more about mpv.

    II) audio/video files options:

                                      ::audio options::
                ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
                │     1) Add more audio links      4) Play current list      │
                │     2) Download current list     5) View current list      │
                │     3) Save playlist as          6) Back to main menu      │
                └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                        Select an item

    The same menu is also prensented in video section.
    Now in this menu it cannot be simpler as it is, all options are applied
    to the specific temporary file and we act directly on it, by entering '5' we will get more
    infos (titles) about the links and a prompt will present the same options as in the menu,
    but now [R]emoving the specific file is available...
