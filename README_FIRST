mpm version 2.5-4

Dependencies: ffmpeg, jq, mpv, socat, vim (any terminal text editor), yt-dlp.
Optionals but recommanded: (
    dialog, fzf, mpvc, ncmpvc (may use socat), GNU parallel,
    ranger (terminal file manager), ueberzug/ffmpegthumbnailer,
    w3m, ytfzf.
)

Youtube-dl is for now kind of unmaintained so install yt-dlp
https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases
sudo pacman -S yt-dlp (it's just the continuation of youtube-dl).

This script rips video urls from Youtube and so on.
In our case we use ".m3u" files to store urls in and then be able
to stream from the site itself or download audio/videos.
Converting .webm files is done using ffmpeg directly or through the parallel program.
We can save, remove or edit playlists, mpmrc (the mpm configuration file).

The installation script will create two configuration files (mpmrc,themerc)
as ~/.config/mpm/{mpmrc,themerc}, so please edit those files first and make sure
the directory names and structure are correctly set.

Changelog:
------------------------------ ADDED CHANGES IN CONFIG FILES ------------------------------
version 2.5-4 - Added and option to determine where does parallel creates its temporary
                folder using export PARALLEL_HOME="/tmp/parallel", change it if you will.
version 2.5-3 - Fixed a bug in _MenuFooter function when use_mpvc=yes and use_fzf=no/empty.
