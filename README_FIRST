mpm version 2.1-2

Dependencies: ffmpeg, jq, mpv, vim (any terminal text editor), yt-dlp.
Optionals but recommanded: (
    fzf, mpvc, ncmpvc (may use socat), GNU parallel, ranger (terminal file manager)
    ueberzug/ffmpegthumbnailer, w3m, wmctrl, ytfzf
)

Youtube-dl is for now kind of unmaintained so install yt-dlp
https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases
sudo pacman -S yt-dlp (it's just the continuation of youtube-dl).

This script rips video urls from Youtube and so on.
In our case we use ".m3u" files to store urls in and then be able
to watch from the site itself or download videos or just the audio.
Converting .webm files is done using ffmpeg directly or through the parallel program.
We can save, remove or edit playlists, mpmrc (the mpm configuration file).

The installation script will create two configuration files (mpmrc,themerc)
as ~/.config/mpm/{mpmrc,themerc}, so please edit those files first and make sure
the directory structure is ok for you.

Changelog:
------------------------ NO CHANGES IN THE CONFIG FILE (mpmrc) ------------------------
version 2.1-2 - For now mpm is getting bloaded, so to ACCELERATE it, just source its config
                files in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc by adding:
                source ~/.config/mpm/mpmrc
                source ~/.config/mpm/themerc
version 2.1-2 - Added _IfDuplicatesFiles functon to check if we want to download already
                existing files in our destination folder (mpm_{audios,videos}).

              - You can just copy it over ~/.config/mpm/themerc (optional).
