mpm version 2.2-7

Dependencies: ffmpeg, jq, mpv, vim (any terminal text editor), yt-dlp.
Optionals but recommanded: (
    dialog, fzf, mpvc, ncmpvc (may use socat), GNU parallel,
    ranger (terminal file manager), ueberzug/ffmpegthumbnailer,
    w3m, ytfzf.
)

Youtube-dl is for now kind of unmaintained so install yt-dlp
https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases
sudo pacman -S yt-dlp (it's just the continuation of youtube-dl).

This script rips video urls from Youtube and so on.
In our case we use ".m3u" files to store urls in and then be able
to watch from the site itself or download videos or just the audio.
Converting .webm files is done using ffmpeg directly or through the parallel program.
We can save, remove or edit playlists, mpmrc (the mpm configuration file).

The installation script will create two configuration files (mpmrc,themerc)
as ~/.config/mpm/{mpmrc,themerc}, so please edit those files first and make sure
the directory structure is ok for you.

Changelog:
------------------------------- NO CHANGES IN THEMERC CONFIG FILE -------------------------------
version 2.2-7 - Added an option to edit ~/.config/mpm/themerc to get "dynamic" changes for main window
                but also for the fzf mpv running interface.
version 2.2-6 - Fixed bug in _FzfEnqueueOptions function when queueing files from multiple directories
                leading to open subshell running in the background so we had to type 'x' twice to quit mpm.
