Dependencies: ffmpeg, jq, mpv, youtube-dl, yt-dlp.
Optionals: parallel, ueberzug, ranger, vim (editor), w3m, wmctrl

Youtube-dl is for now kind of unmaintained so install and make a symlink with
https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases
sudo pacman -S yt-dlp youtube-dl
ln -s /usr/bin/yt-dlp ~/.local/bin/youtube-dl (if ~/.local/bin is in your $PATH)

This script rips video urls from Youtube and so on.
In our case we use ".m3u" files to store urls in and then be able
to watch from the site itself or download videos or just the audio.
We can save, remove or edit playlists, mpv.conf.

The installation script will create two configuration files (mpmrc,themerc)
as ~/.config/mpm/{mpmrc,themerc}, so please edit those files first and make sure
the directory structure is ok for you.
