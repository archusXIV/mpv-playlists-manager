mpm version 2.0-5

Dependencies: ffmpeg, jq, mpv, vim (any terminal text editor), yt-dlp.
Optionals but recommanded: (
    fzf, mpvc, ncmpvc (may use socat), GNU parallel, ranger (terminal file manager)
    ueberzug/ffmpegthumbnailer, w3m, wmctrl, ytfzf
)

Youtube-dl is for now kind of unmaintained so install yt-dlp
https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases
sudo pacman -S yt-dlp (it's just the continuation of youtbe-dl).

This script rips video urls from Youtube and so on.
In our case we use ".m3u" files to store urls in and then be able
to watch from the site itself or download videos or just the audio.
Converting .webm files is done using ffmpeg directly or through the parallel program.
We can save, remove or edit playlists, mpmrc (the mpm configuration file).

The installation script will create two configuration files (mpmrc,themerc)
as ~/.config/mpm/{mpmrc,themerc}, so please edit those files first and make sure
the directory structure is ok for you.

Changelog:
--------------- NO CHANGE IN THE CONFIG FILE (mpmrc) ---------------
version 2.0-5 - Added mpv output in the terminal by queueing multiple files/dirs,
                when use_mpvc is empty (not set).
version 2.0-5 - Fixed bug in _IfQuitAfterTask function after downloads completed.
version 2.0-4 - Added ncmpvc cheatsheet by typing 'm' in main window.
version 2.0-4 - Added _MpvControl function to deal with mpv interactions.
                This works when mpvc_tui variable is filled or not,
                use_mpvc must be set to 'yes/no'.
version 2.0-4 - Added more keyboard shortcuts in the main window (see help screen).
