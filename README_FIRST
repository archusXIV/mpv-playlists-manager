mpm version 2.4-8

Dependencies: ffmpeg, jq, mpv, vim (any terminal text editor), yt-dlp.
Optionals but recommanded: (
    dialog, fzf, mpvc, ncmpvc (may use socat), GNU parallel,
    ranger (terminal file manager), ueberzug/ffmpegthumbnailer,
    w3m, ytfzf.
)

Youtube-dl is for now kind of unmaintained so install yt-dlp
https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases
sudo pacman -S yt-dlp (it's just the continuation of youtube-dl).

This script rips video urls from Youtube and so on.
In our case we use ".m3u" files to store urls in and then be able
to stream from the site itself or download audio/videos.
Converting .webm files is done using ffmpeg directly or through the parallel program.
We can save, remove or edit playlists, mpmrc (the mpm configuration file).

The installation script will create two configuration files (mpmrc,themerc)
as ~/.config/mpm/{mpmrc,themerc}, so please edit those files first and make sure
the directory names and structure are correctly set.

Changelog:
------------------------------- NO CHANGES IN CONFIG FILES -------------------------------
version 2.4-8 - Refactored _ParallelDownloadCmd by merging xargs commands
version 2.4-7 - Refactored _IfWebmFiles function to be more concise.
version 2.4-7 - Added _FzfLoadMultiplePlaylists function to play/download several playlists
                from our collection, but be aware that when using the downloading option,
                selected playlists are indeed physically removed as they are in single mode.
