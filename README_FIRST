mpm version 1.9-1

Dependencies: ffmpeg, jq, mpv, vim (any terminal text editor), yt-dlp.
Optionals but recommanded: (
    fzf, mpvc, ncmpvc (may use socat), GNU parallel, ranger (terminal file manager)
    ueberzug/ffmpegthumbnailer, w3m, wmctrl, ytfzf
)

Youtube-dl is for now kind of unmaintained so install yt-dlp
https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases
sudo pacman -S yt-dlp (it's just the continuation of youtbe-dl).

This script rips video urls from Youtube and so on.
In our case we use ".m3u" files to store urls in and then be able
to watch from the site itself or download videos or just the audio.
Converting .webm files is done using ffmpeg directly or through the parallel program.
We can save, remove or edit playlists, mpmrc (the mpm configuration file).

The installation script will create two configuration files (mpmrc,themerc)
as ~/.config/mpm/{mpmrc,themerc}, so please edit those files first and make sure
the directory structure is ok for you.

Changelog:
version 1.9-2 - Added explainations in mpmrc for parallel downloads.
version 1.9-2 - if the themerc file is missing, then the default theme is used.
version 1.9-2 - Some functions optimyzations.
version 1.9-1 - Added few changes in ~/.config/mpm/mpmrc, please update that file.
version 1.9-1 - Added xargs multi-process in case the parallel package isn't installed.
version 1.9-1 - Few bugs fixed.
version 1.9-1 - Added option 'T' to display mpv title in main window (socat must be installed).
