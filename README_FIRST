mpm version 2.0-8

Dependencies: ffmpeg, jq, mpv, vim (any terminal text editor), yt-dlp.
Optionals but recommanded: (
    fzf, mpvc, ncmpvc (may use socat), GNU parallel, ranger (terminal file manager)
    ueberzug/ffmpegthumbnailer, w3m, wmctrl, ytfzf
)

Youtube-dl is for now kind of unmaintained so install yt-dlp
https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases
sudo pacman -S yt-dlp (it's just the continuation of youtbe-dl).

This script rips video urls from Youtube and so on.
In our case we use ".m3u" files to store urls in and then be able
to watch from the site itself or download videos or just the audio.
Converting .webm files is done using ffmpeg directly or through the parallel program.
We can save, remove or edit playlists, mpmrc (the mpm configuration file).

The installation script will create two configuration files (mpmrc,themerc)
as ~/.config/mpm/{mpmrc,themerc}, so please edit those files first and make sure
the directory structure is ok for you.

Changelog:
--------------- NO CHANGE IN THE CONFIG FILE (mpmrc) ---------------
version 2.0-8 - Refactored _Menu function (main window) in multiple parts.
version 2.0-8 - Fixed (disabled) keyboard arrow keys redirecting to wrong function.
                For example up arrow output is: '\[A', so 'A' leads to create audio list...
version 2.0-7 - Change theme name 'chocolat-pistache' to 'pistachio' for aesthetic reason.
version 2.0-7 - Added an url test in _CopyMediaUrl function, if not an url the clipboard is cleared.
version 2.0-7 - Added _MpmrcTasksList function to get a quick mpmrc settings view (Ctrl+M).
