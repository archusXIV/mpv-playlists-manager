https://github.com/archusXIV/mpv-playlists-manager/blob/main/mpm
mpm version 2.1-5

Dependencies: ffmpeg, jq, mpv, vim (any terminal text editor), yt-dlp.
Optionals but recommanded: (
    fzf, mpvc, ncmpvc (may use socat), GNU parallel, ranger (terminal file manager)
    ueberzug/ffmpegthumbnailer, w3m, wmctrl, ytfzf
)

Youtube-dl is for now kind of unmaintained so install yt-dlp
https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases
sudo pacman -S yt-dlp (it's just the continuation of youtube-dl).

This script rips video urls from Youtube and so on.
In our case we use ".m3u" files to store urls in and then be able
to watch from the site itself or download videos or just the audio.
Converting .webm files is done using ffmpeg directly or through the parallel program.
We can save, remove or edit playlists, mpmrc (the mpm configuration file).

The installation script will create two configuration files (mpmrc,themerc)
as ~/.config/mpm/{mpmrc,themerc}, so please edit those files first and make sure
the directory structure is ok for you.

Changelog:
------------- !!! ADDED CHANGES IN MPMRC, PLEASE REVIEW YOUR CONFIG FILE !!! -------------
version 2.1-5 - Added new window size settings in ~/.config/mpm/mpmrc.
version 2.1-5 - As a gift I provide a new software (somabox) to listen to somafm
                radio stations through _LoadLocalMenu option. Place it in your $PATH.
version 2.1-5 - Added also an option to load radio playlists files (.pls,.m3u, etc...)
                if you store them in a specific folder, fill in this option in your
                configuration file: radio_dir="/path/to/web_radio_files".
version 2.1-4 - Added mpvc_tui_cheatsheet variable in mpmrc in case your mpv tui program
                isn't ncmpvc and you have a cheatsheet to check at some point.
                Use the full path for it.
version 2.1-4 - Added _ManualsMenu function so you can get help configuring mpmrc.
                Just press 'M' in the main window to access this feature.
version 2.1-4 - Refactored _MenuBody function to make it easier to manage.
