mpm version 2.2-6

Dependencies: ffmpeg, jq, mpv, vim (any terminal text editor), yt-dlp.
Optionals but recommanded: (
    dialog, fzf, mpvc, ncmpvc (may use socat), GNU parallel,
    ranger (terminal file manager), ueberzug/ffmpegthumbnailer,
    w3m, ytfzf.
)

Youtube-dl is for now kind of unmaintained so install yt-dlp
https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases
sudo pacman -S yt-dlp (it's just the continuation of youtube-dl).

This script rips video urls from Youtube and so on.
In our case we use ".m3u" files to store urls in and then be able
to watch from the site itself or download videos or just the audio.
Converting .webm files is done using ffmpeg directly or through the parallel program.
We can save, remove or edit playlists, mpmrc (the mpm configuration file).

The installation script will create two configuration files (mpmrc,themerc)
as ~/.config/mpm/{mpmrc,themerc}, so please edit those files first and make sure
the directory structure is ok for you.

Changelog:
------------------------------- !!! ADDED CHANGES IN THEMERC CONFIG FILE !!! -------------------------------
version 2.2-6 - Fixed bug in _FzfEnqueueOptions function when queueing files from multiple directories
                leading to open subshell running in the background so we had to type 'x' twice to quit mpm.
version 2.2-5 - Added a native mpv tui to replace ncmpvc as the default player for any kind of playlist
                that we want to pass to mpv, see help or bindings to control your playlist
                inside this fzf "player". Colors can be change in ~/.config/mpm/themerc.
version 2.2-5 - If use_fzf is set to yes and fzf is installed, loading/editing/removing playlists
                is done through a fzf menu to select which collection playlist to act on.
version 2.2-5 - Fixed bug in _MvpOwnsTmplist when tmp_dir/mpv.pid exist.
