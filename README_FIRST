https://github.com/archusXIV/mpv-playlists-manager/blob/main/mpm
mpm version 2.3-2

Dependencies: ffmpeg, jq, mpv, vim (any terminal text editor), yt-dlp.
Optionals but recommanded: (
    dialog, fzf, mpvc, ncmpvc (may use socat), GNU parallel,
    ranger (terminal file manager), ueberzug/ffmpegthumbnailer,
    w3m, ytfzf.
)

Youtube-dl is for now kind of unmaintained so install yt-dlp
https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases
sudo pacman -S yt-dlp (it's just the continuation of youtube-dl).

This script rips video urls from Youtube and so on.
In our case we use ".m3u" files to store urls in and then be able
to watch from the site itself or download videos or just the audio.
Converting .webm files is done using ffmpeg directly or through the parallel program.
We can save, remove or edit playlists, mpmrc (the mpm configuration file).

The installation script will create two configuration files (mpmrc,themerc)
as ~/.config/mpm/{mpmrc,themerc}, so please edit those files first and make sure
the directory names and structure is ok for you.

Changelog:
------------------------ NO CHANGES IN THEMERC & MPMRC CONFIG FILES -----------------------
version 2.3-2 - YtFzf is no longer used to get all titles/urls from a Youtube playlist.
version 2.3-2 - Now you can install mpm using the makefile (sudo make install) but you will have review
                the {mpm,theme}rc files manually before installation or first run.
version 2.3-2 - Fixed bug in _CheckParallelDownloads so we can use xargs instead of GNU parallel.
                In your mpmrc file settings will be:
                use_parallel=no and use_parallel_downloads=yes.
version 2.3-2 - Added a test to check if all collection playlists have their titles files
                before launching the selection menu with fzf.
version 2.3-2 - Added a function to remove multiple collection playlists at once.
version 2.3-1 - Fixed bug when trying to check our temporary titles and the file does not exist,
                this could occur du to the below bug, so now we update this file in that case.
version 2.3-1 - Fixed bug when saving temporary list if collection playlist already exists.
