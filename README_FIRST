mpm version 2.4-2

Dependencies: ffmpeg, jq, mpv, vim (any terminal text editor), yt-dlp.
Optionals but recommanded: (
    dialog, fzf, mpvc, ncmpvc (may use socat), GNU parallel,
    ranger (terminal file manager), ueberzug/ffmpegthumbnailer,
    w3m, ytfzf.
)

Youtube-dl is for now kind of unmaintained so install yt-dlp
https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases
sudo pacman -S yt-dlp (it's just the continuation of youtube-dl).

This script rips video urls from Youtube and so on.
In our case we use ".m3u" files to store urls in and then be able
to stream from the site itself or download audio/videos.
Converting .webm files is done using ffmpeg directly or through the parallel program.
We can save, remove or edit playlists, mpmrc (the mpm configuration file).

The installation script will create two configuration files (mpmrc,themerc)
as ~/.config/mpm/{mpmrc,themerc}, so please edit those files first and make sure
the directory names and structure are correctly set.

Changelog:
--------------------------------- NO CHANGES IN CONFIG FILES ---------------------------------
version 2.4-2 - Added _RestoreSchedules function to fix problems when files are missing.
version 2.4-2 - Added a test in the _ViewScheduledList function to see if the $schedules_dir
                contains any .m3u file and if the schedules.txt file exists.
version 2.4-1 - Now mpm has a man page!!! just type man mpm in your terminal.
version 2.4-1 - Added _IfDuplicatesUrls function that parse our collection of playlists
                and check if we copied URLs already present in that collection, and if so
                the duplicates aren't saved except in the default list.
