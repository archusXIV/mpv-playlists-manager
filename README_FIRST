mpm version 2.3-6

Dependencies: ffmpeg, jq, mpv, vim (any terminal text editor), yt-dlp.
Optionals but recommanded: (
    dialog, fzf, mpvc, ncmpvc (may use socat), GNU parallel,
    ranger (terminal file manager), ueberzug/ffmpegthumbnailer,
    w3m, ytfzf.
)

Youtube-dl is for now kind of unmaintained so install yt-dlp
https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases
sudo pacman -S yt-dlp (it's just the continuation of youtube-dl).

This script rips video urls from Youtube and so on.
In our case we use ".m3u" files to store urls in and then be able
to watch from the site itself or download videos or just the audio.
Converting .webm files is done using ffmpeg directly or through the parallel program.
We can save, remove or edit playlists, mpmrc (the mpm configuration file).

The installation script will create two configuration files (mpmrc,themerc)
as ~/.config/mpm/{mpmrc,themerc}, so please edit those files first and make sure
the directory names and structure are ok for you.

Changelog:
-------------------------------- NO CHANGES IN CONFIG FILES -------------------------------
version 2.3-6 - Fixed bug when removing links/titles from temporary lists.
version 2.3-5 - Added an option to check and upgrade mpm version, just type mpm --upgrade
version 2.3-4 - Now we can change the background color, just edit the bg variable in
                ~/.config/mpm/themerc, section "_Theme" on each options (themes names).
