mpm version 2.2-2

Dependencies: ffmpeg, jq, mpv, vim (any terminal text editor), yt-dlp.
Optionals but recommanded: (
    dialog, fzf, mpvc, ncmpvc (may use socat), GNU parallel,
    ranger (terminal file manager), ueberzug/ffmpegthumbnailer,
    w3m, wmctrl, ytfzf.
)

Youtube-dl is for now kind of unmaintained so install yt-dlp
https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases
sudo pacman -S yt-dlp (it's just the continuation of youtube-dl).

This script rips video urls from Youtube and so on.
In our case we use ".m3u" files to store urls in and then be able
to watch from the site itself or download videos or just the audio.
Converting .webm files is done using ffmpeg directly or through the parallel program.
We can save, remove or edit playlists, mpmrc (the mpm configuration file).

The installation script will create two configuration files (mpmrc,themerc)
as ~/.config/mpm/{mpmrc,themerc}, so please edit those files first and make sure
the directory structure is ok for you.

Changelog:
---------------------------------- NO CHANGES IN MPMRC CONFIG FILE ----------------------------------

version 2.2-2 - Added a cancel option when choosing save/remove a playlist.
version 2.2-2 - the parallel method to get youtube playlists links/titles is preferred over ytfzf
                because of the weak reliabily of its maintenance even if it is prioritized for searching videos.

version 2.2-2 - Revomed some sed replacements by pure bash substitution syntax.
