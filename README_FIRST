mpm version 1.9-9

Dependencies: ffmpeg, jq, mpv, vim (any terminal text editor), yt-dlp.
Optionals but recommanded: (
    fzf, mpvc, ncmpvc (may use socat), GNU parallel, ranger (terminal file manager)
    ueberzug/ffmpegthumbnailer, w3m, wmctrl, ytfzf
)

Youtube-dl is for now kind of unmaintained so install yt-dlp
https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases
sudo pacman -S yt-dlp (it's just the continuation of youtbe-dl).

This script rips video urls from Youtube and so on.
In our case we use ".m3u" files to store urls in and then be able
to watch from the site itself or download videos or just the audio.
Converting .webm files is done using ffmpeg directly or through the parallel program.
We can save, remove or edit playlists, mpmrc (the mpm configuration file).

The installation script will create two configuration files (mpmrc,themerc)
as ~/.config/mpm/{mpmrc,themerc}, so please edit those files first and make sure
the directory structure is ok for you.

Changelog:
--------------- NO CHANGE IN THE CONFIG FILE (mpmrc) ---------------
version 1.9-9 - Added an option to queue more files in _LoadLocalMenu function.
version 1.9-9 - Added _LoadLocalMenu function.
version 1.9-8 - When mpv stops you can press 'r' to refresh the main menu,
                the mpv tui program (if launched) exits and the main menu
                appears again, so turn mpvGenOptions_ID=( --idle ) to mpvGenOptions_ID=( --idle=no ) in mpmrc.
version 1.9-8 - Fixed rm messages in _ClearAllTmpLists function
                when trying to remove none existing files in tmp_dir.
